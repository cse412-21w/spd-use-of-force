        <a href="/">Police Violence In Seattle</a>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>On average, there are 1,723 incidents of police violence in Seattle every year</h2>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>With the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, and more recently, the protests following the
          death of George Floyd on May 25th, 2020, the issue of police violence has risen prominently in the
          public consciousness.</p>
        <p> Though Seattle is thought of as a progressive city, its police department has a long and bloody
          history. In 2011, an investigation by the Department of Justice found that the SPD had engaged in a
          <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-releases-investigative-findings-seattle-police-department">
            "pattern or practice of excessive force that violates the Constitution and federal law"</a>.
          Since then, the SPD has at least in theory made efforts to curb the issue. One story that made
          headlines was the <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/family-of-charleena-lyles-unhappy-seattle-police-wont-participate-in-community-forum/">
          death of Charleena Lyles</a>, a Black woman who was fatally shot in front of her children by
          Seattle police in 2017 after she reported a burglary. More recently, following the George Floyd
          protests this summer, the SPD was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/08/944479936/seattle-police-ruled-in-contempt-for-firing-less-lethal-weapons-at-blm-protester">
            ruled in contempt</a> by a federal judge for violating an order barring the use of force on
            peaceful protestors.</p>
        <p>Every one of these incidents - the DoJ report, the death of Charleena Lyles, the BLM protests
          this summer - has sparked a conversation around the role of police violence and its disproportionate
          impact on minorities. Every time, the SPD promises to do better. </p>
        <p>Has it succeeded? Let's take a look at the data.</p>

        <h2> Where did this data come from? </h2>
        <p>This data comes from the City of Seattle
          <a href="https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Use-Of-Force/ppi5-g2bj."> open data portal</a>.
          It records all incidents where members of the Seattle Police Department used force on a member of the
          public, starting from January 2014 and continuing up to the present. It includes information on location,
          date and time of the incident, race and gender of the subject, and the level of force.
          You can find more information about the dataset 
          <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/police/information-and-data/use-of-force-data">here</a>.</p>
        <p> The Use of Force (UoF) dataset recognizes four levels of force:
          <ul>
            <li> Type I: force that causes transitory pain or the complaint of transitory pain, not
              including handcuff discomfort, which is reported separately.
            </li>
            <li> Type II: force that causes or is reasonably expected to cause physical injury greater
              than transitory pain but less than great or substantial bodily harm.
            </li>
            <li> Type III: force that causes or is reasonably expected to cause great bodily harm,
              substantial bodily harm, loss of consciousness, or death.
            </li>
            <li> Type IV: Type IV: officer-involved shooting.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p> It's worth noting how much the trend changes depending on what period of time you look at.</p>
        <p> Clearly, not all races are affected equally by police violence. But maybe that can be explained
          by the demographics of the neighborhoods? What about economic factors, do those play a role?

        <p>Series of bar graphs showing the racial distribution of the population, then of UoF subjects,
          then the difference between them, to really nail down the level of racial bias in the SPD.
          (Logic: If race had no impact on an individual's likelihood to be involved in a UoF incident,
          we'd expect the proportion of UoF subjects of each race to be more or less the same as the
          proportion of the Seattle population of each race.) Ideally animate the transitions between
          them, to make it easier to follow.

          Current Status: I made a bar graph in Observable that had somewhat working transitions. The transfer
          over to embedding it into the webpage has proven to be a bit more difficult than anticipiated. The link to the observable 
          notebook can be found <a href="https://observablehq.com/@nicolegooding/i-am-trying-to-make-an-animated-bar-graph"> here </a>
